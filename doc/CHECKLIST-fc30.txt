To configure a vanilla Fedora 30 installation to a webhackathon server,
follow this checklist.

0. Start with a fresh Fedora 30 install.  If you port this SW to another
   distro/version, create a new checklist for it and try not to change things
   in a way that breaks Fedora 30.

1. Install the basics you care about, something like:
	dnf git install ipmctl ndctl sudo vim-enhanced
	# fc30 timedatectl bug workaround:
		cd /etc
		rm localtime
		ln -s ../usr/share/zoneinfo/MST7MDT localtime
	make sure the machine has a DNS entry

2. Arrange for NetworkManager to treat docker networks as unmanaged:
	/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:
		[main]
		plugins=keyfile

		[keyfile]
		unmanaged-devices=interface-name:veth*
	systemctl restart NetworkManager

3. Install docker:
	# following instructions from:
	# https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/
	# https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/
	dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
	# docker repo doesn't have builds for fc30 yet, so use fc29's
	dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io --releasever=29
	systemctl start docker
	systemctl enable docker
	# test it
	docker run hello-world

4. Allow ports 80 and 443 through Fedora's firewall:
	firewall-cmd --state
	firewall-cmd --list-ports
	firewall-cmd --list-services
	# run once to change it at run-time, once to make it permanent
	firewall-cmd --add-service=http
	firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
	firewall-cmd --add-service=https
	firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent

5. Install an https cert:
	dnf install certbot
	certbot certonly --standalone
	# webhackathon daemon will expect certs where certbot puts them:
	#	/etc/letsencrypt/live/<host>.<domain>/*.pem
	# crontab entry to renew each month as described here:
		https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/fedora-other

6. Add a root cron job to expire old webhackathon sessions:
	crontab -e
		@daily root find /home/hackathon/sessions -mtime +1 -type f -delete

7. Install webhackathon software:
	(non-root) clone the webhackathon repo in your home dir
	(non-root) clone the YYYY-MM-DD repo in your home dir
	(root) from root of webhackathon repo, run scripts/create_hackathon_account
		repeat this, fixing issues, until all the steps are successful
