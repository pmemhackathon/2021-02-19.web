Unless you are setting up a hackathon/workshop, you probably
aren't interested in the files in this repo.  Here's where we
keep the HTML templates, images, css, and js files that provide
the web-based content presented by the tool.  The binary webhackathon
is the web server itself (the source for that lives in another repo).
