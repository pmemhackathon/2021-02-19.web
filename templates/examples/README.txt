Contents of this directory tree:

	- Subdirectories contain examples ("A", "B", etc)
	- common templates for examples are in *.tmpl

Here what each tmpl file is for:

scrollToContinue.tmpl	Inserts "Scroll to continue" and arrow.
			Used to create a downward scrolling flow
			in the top section of each example.  The body
			of the example has a short, "attention-grabbing"
			paragraph, then {{template "scrollToContinue"}},
			then the rest of the intro HTML.

The tmpl files below are never used directly by other templates.  They
are only invoked by server.go as described below.

pageStart.tmpl		These two are invoked by server.go when
topStart.tmpl		processing the {{top "title"}} directive
			in examples/?/body.tmpl.

build.tmpl		Build button and results pane.  Invoked by
			server.go when processing the {{build}}
			directive in examples/?/body.tmpl.

editStart.tmpl		These three are invoked by server.go when
editTab.tmpl		processing the {{edit ...}} directive in
editEnd.tmpl		examples/?/body.tmpl.  editTab.tmpl is invoked
			for each tab in the tabset.

runStart.tmpl		These three are invoked by server.go when
runTab.tmpl		processing the {{run "file"}} directive in
runEnd.tmpl		in examples/?/body.tmpl.  The first three
run.tmpl		provide the single edit tab for the script
			that will run.  run.tmpl provides the run
			button and results pane.

stepStart.tmpl		This is invoked by server.go when processing the
			{{step "title"}} directive in examples/?/body.tmpl.

summaryStart.tmpl	This is invoked by server.go when processing
			the {{summary "title"}} directive in
			examples/?/body.tmpl.

pageEnd.tmpl		This is invoked by server.go when processing the
			{{bottom}} directive of examples/?/body.tmpl.


Each example directory corresponds to the example directory
in the hackathon YYYY-MM-DD repo.  Any files edited or scripts
run will come from the repo and won't be found here.  The things
that live in this tree are:

	- a props.tmpl that defines at least two templates:
		title       a brief name for the example
		description a paragraph or so describing it
	- any pictures in the img subdectory
		referenced in HTML like this:
			<img src="img/mmap.jpg" class="figure">
	- a body.tmpl following the overall form below

Here's the form for body.tmpl (the words in CAPS get replaced
with the appropriate content).
---------------------------------------------------------------

{{top "TITLE"}}

HTML

{{step "STEP_NAME"}}

HTML

...

{{summary}}

HTML

{{bottom}}

---------------------------------------------------------------

As appropriate, tabbed editor panes are generated by:

{{edit "FILE1" "FILE2"}}

And build and run buttons are generated by:

{{build}}

{{run "FILE"}}
